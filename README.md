## 🔍 Overview

### The Problem

Migrating a Java project from Java 11 to Java 21 is not a one-line version bump. It is weeks of manual work:

- Hundreds of `javax.*` imports need renaming to `jakarta.*`
- Spring Boot 2.x APIs are incompatible with Spring Boot 3.x
- `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was removed entirely in Spring Security 6
- JUnit 4 annotations break under JUnit 5
- Dozens of Maven dependencies need version upgrades — each requiring manual research
- Build plugins need reconfiguration for the modern `<release>` compiler flag
- Every change carries risk of breaking the application silently

For enterprise codebases with hundreds of Java files and dozens of dependencies, this process takes experienced engineers days or weeks — and is still error-prone.

### The Solution

**AI Java Migration Assistant** automates the entire assessment and migration pipeline. Drop in a ZIP of any Maven or Gradle project and get back:

- A **full migration assessment** with risk scoring, dependency analysis, and code refactoring signals
- An **automatically updated `pom.xml`** with every dependency version resolved live from Maven Central
- **Refactored Java source files** with 26 transformation rules applied precisely and safely
- A **detailed HTML Migration Change Report** showing every file changed, every rule applied, and every version bumped — with full audit trail

No manual research. No missed imports. No forgotten dependency upgrades. Every change is documented.
